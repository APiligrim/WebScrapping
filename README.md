# WebScrapping with BeautifulSoup
Web-scraping job applications with BeautifulSoup
#### **Main Idea**: Web Scrape the website Indeed.com to see internship openings for open Software Engineering positions and spot trends for:
        - programming skills (languages, frameworks, types of experiences) that are most in demand 
        - what types of different SE intern positions are there
        - compare how salary for SE interns (if available) is different across different states 
        - does company rating affect salary and qualification requirements?
